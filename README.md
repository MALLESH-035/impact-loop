## 🚨 Image Upload Handling (Replit-Compatible)

Replit restricts traditional file uploads inside its preview environment.

✅ ImpactLoop solves this using:
- `URL.createObjectURL(file)`
- Instant image preview
- LocalStorage persistence
- No server or backend dependency

This approach is used for:
- Profile photo uploads
- Reflection images
- Story images

---

## ✅ Feasibility

ImpactLoop is highly feasible because:
- It is built entirely on the frontend
- Requires no backend or APIs
- Uses browser-native capabilities
- Runs smoothly on Replit, Vercel, and local environments

The architecture allows easy future expansion with backend services if required.
